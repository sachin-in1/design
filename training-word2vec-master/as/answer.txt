Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE) is an algorithm to automatically extract keywords from documents. Keywords are sequences of one or more words that, together, provide a compact representation of content. RAKE is a well-known and widely used NLP technique, but its concrete application depends a lot on factors like the language in which the content is written, the domain of the content and the purpose of the keywords.
